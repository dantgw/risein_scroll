# Analogy for ZKP
I have 2 marbles with different colors.
How do I prove to a color-blind person that these 2 marbles are indeed of different colors?
If I give the 2 marbles to the color-blind person, 1 in each hand, and give him the option to swap them behind his back.
When he reveals the 2 marbles again, I would be able to tell if he swapped them behind his back.
Repeat this process multiple times until the color-blind person is convinced that I got it right not just by guessing.
The color-blind person does not gain any knowledge about the color of the marbles.

Certain web apps can only be used by people of a certain age. eg: social media, gore content. How do I prove to the web app that I am indeed old enough to use it without revealing my birthday?

# Integrating ZKP
Use zero-knowledge to proof that I am above a certain age without revealing my birthdate. Could be in the form of an oracle providing the credential.
